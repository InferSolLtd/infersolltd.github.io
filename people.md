        <h2>Harry Bevins: Company Director and Lead Analyst</h2>
        <p>I am a consultant specializing in machine learning and data analysis. With a background in astrophysics and a strong foundation in Bayesian inference, machine learning, and statistics, I offer tailored solutions to complex data problems. I work closely with businesses to help them unlock insights from their data and improve their operations through advanced analytical techniques.
        I am currently a research fellow working at the University of Cambridge on
        applications of machine learning to the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. I 
        recieved my PhD from the University of Cambridge in 2023.</p>
