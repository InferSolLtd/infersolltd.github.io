At InferSol, we help businesses make better decisions by applying machine learning and statistical analysis to their data. Based in Cambridge and drawing on years of research experience at the University of Cambridge, we specialise in building practical, tailored solutions — not off-the-shelf tools, but approaches designed around your specific problem.

## What we do

We offer three core services:

**Machine learning applications** — From predictive models to anomaly detection, we build small-scale ML systems that integrate directly with your workflows. Whether you need to forecast demand, classify customer behaviour, or surface patterns in operational data, we can help scope, build, and validate the right approach.

**Data analysis** — Sometimes the most valuable step is simply understanding what your data is telling you. We apply rigorous statistical methods — including Bayesian inference — to extract clear, actionable insights and help you ask better questions of your data.

**Workshops and training** — We run hands-on sessions designed to build your team's confidence with data science and machine learning tools. These range from introductory sessions for non-technical audiences to deeper technical workshops for analysts and engineers.

## Our approach

A lot of consultancy in this space over-promises and under-delivers. We take a different view: every engagement starts with understanding the business problem first, before any modelling. We favour interpretable, well-validated models over black-box complexity, and we work closely with clients throughout rather than handing over a report at the end.

## Get in touch

If you have a data problem you're not sure how to approach, we'd be happy to have an initial conversation. Drop us an email at [infersol.coms@gmail.com](mailto:infersol.coms@gmail.com) or use the [contact form](/contact.html).
